# Vesting Implementation Summary

## ✅ What's Been Added

### 1. Updated Presale Page
The presale page now prominently displays:
- **Vesting Schedule**: 20% at TGE, 80% over 18 months
- **Value Proposition**: How platform fees drive token value
- **Staking Opportunities**: Earn rewards during vesting
- **Protection Benefits**: Why vesting protects investors

### 2. Vesting Strategy Document
Created `CFY_VESTING_STRATEGY.md` with:
- Recommended vesting schedule (20% TGE + 18 months)
- Staking integration strategy
- Implementation guidance
- Expected outcomes and timeline

## 🎯 Recommended Vesting Schedule

**20% at TGE + 80% Linear over 18 Months**

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Protects token from dumps
- ✅ Gives platform time to grow
- ✅ Rewards early supporters (20% immediate)
- ✅ Long enough for value to build (18 months)
- ✅ Balanced approach (not too aggressive/conservative)

## 💡 Staking During Vesting - Your Idea is Excellent!

**Benefits:**
1. **Double Rewards**: Earn staking APY while tokens vest
2. **Natural Lock-up**: Staking prevents immediate selling
3. **Value Appreciation**: Tokens earn rewards while platform fees build value
4. **Community Building**: Stakers are long-term supporters

**Recommended Approach:**
- Allow staking of **vested tokens** immediately
- Consider staking **unvested tokens** (advanced feature)
- Offer multiple staking pools (15% to 50% APY)
- Show staking rewards in user dashboard

## 🚀 Why This Strategy Works

2. **Builds Value**: Gives platform time to generate fees
3. **Rewards Supporters**: 20% immediate + staking rewards
4. **Creates Community**: Long-term holders = engaged community
5. **Sustainable Growth**: Gradual release = stable price growth

Your idea to allow staking during vesting is **brilliant** - it turns a "restriction" into an **opportunity** for additional rewards!
